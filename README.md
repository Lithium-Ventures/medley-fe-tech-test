## Approach

Based on Figma plugins I generated code for React/TypeScript/styled components. The project's general folder and file structure were created. All the generated code was transferred into the created structure step-by-step.

- TypeScript
- Redux (ver. 4.2.1)
- Redux-Saga
- Styled Components
